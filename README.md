My keyboard modifications from Karabiner

Caps Lock is mapped to hyper (command-control-option-shift) when you hold it down (giving you access to basically your entire keyboard for new keyboard shortcuts). When you just tap it, caps lock is Escape.

Hold Caps lock + sdfe for videogame like wasd navigation for your cursor (left-down-up-right). Hold caps lock + a/g to jump a word left or right. Caps lock + semicolon for the end of the line, p for the beginning of the line.

The right command key is remapped to control to make it more accessible on mac keyboards.

There's probably more stuff but that's all I really use. I don't code, I larp code, so I downloaded prebuilt stuff and made a couple of modifications. I think there's something in there that lets you move your cursor from the keyboard but honestly I don't remember and you probably won't encounter it by accident.
